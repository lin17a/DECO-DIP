# **DECO-DIP**: <br> **Deep Image Prior for Spatio-Temporal Fluorescence Microscopy Images**

<br>
<br>

## General Information

DECO-DIP denoises and deconvolves microscopy images. It is based on Deep image prior ([DIP](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/deep-image-prior)) and does not require any training data. This version of DIP provides a new loss function, that includes an additional term to model the forward model of the imaging process. Additionally, the time dependence of image series can be used.

Synthetic test data can be created using the code from [TDEntropyDeconvolution](https://github.com/IPMI-ICNS-UKE/TDEntropyDeconvolution/), which is a submodule of this repo.
