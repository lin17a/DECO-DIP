Synthetic data can be created with ../TDEntropyDeconvolution/example_synthetic.py

For more information about the general parameters please refer to the following [Documentation](https://ipmi-icns-uke.github.io/TDEntropyDeconvolution/Synthetic%20Data/1-parameters.html). Available parameters for the point spread function are explained [here](https://ipmi-icns-uke.github.io/TDEntropyDeconvolution/General/2-usage.html#point-spread-function) and how to implement them into data creation process is shown [here](https://ipmi-icns-uke.github.io/TDEntropyDeconvolution/Synthetic%20Data/2-deconvolution.html#creation-of-noisy-synthetic-data).
